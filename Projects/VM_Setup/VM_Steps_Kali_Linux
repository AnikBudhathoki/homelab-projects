# Kali Linux Prebuilt VM Setup on VirtualBox

## Objective
Set up a Kali Linux prebuilt virtual machine using VirtualBox

## Tools Used
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Kali Linux prebuilt VM image from the official Kali website
- Host machine running Windows/Linux/macOS

## Steps

1. **Download and Install VirtualBox**  
   Download the latest version of VirtualBox from (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install it on your host machine

2. **Download Kali Linux Prebuilt VM Image**  
   Download the official Kali Linux file from the Kali Linux website:  
(https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
    After downloading this folder, make sure you have a file extractor such as 7zip or WinRAR to extract the files
    

3. **Open File and Run the file ending in the extenstion .vbox **  

4. **Start the Kali Linux VM**        
    -After Running the .vbox file, your virutal machine should automatically install the configurations for Kali Linux
   - Power on the VM and log in with the default credentials:  
     - Username: `kali`  
     - Password: `kali`  

6. **Update Kali Linux**  
   - Open a terminal and run:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```  
   - Reboot if necessary.

## Challenges & Notes
- Ensure the internal network is correctly set up to allow communication with other VMs (like your Windows VM).  
- Using the prebuilt VM speeds up lab setup, avoiding manual installation.

## What I Learned
- How to import and configure prebuilt VM images in VirtualBox.  
- Basic Kali Linux usage and security best practices (like changing default credentials).  
- Network configuration to integrate Kali with other lab machines.
