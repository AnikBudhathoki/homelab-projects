# Home Lab Projects

Welcome to my Home Lab Projects repository! This is where I document my hands-on experiments and learning with networking, cybersecurity, virtualization, and cloud technologies. The goal of this lab is to deepen my practical skills and build a portfolio of applied knowledge.

### Virtual Environment Setup
- Installed and configured Windows 10 and Kali Linux on **VirtualBox**
- Created a secure **internal network** for isolated communication between VMs

### ðŸ”¹ Offensive Security (Red Team)
- Created a custom payload using `msfvenom` on Kali Linux
- Executed the payload on Windows via Metasploit (`msfconsole`)
- Simulated attacker behavior to generate meaningful telemetry

### ðŸ”¹ Defensive Security (Blue Team)
- Installed and configured Sysmon on the Windows VM for system event logging
- Set up Splunk to collect and visualize logs

  
## Tools & Technologies
- VirtualBox, Kali Linux, Windows 10
- Metasploit Framework (`msfvenom`, `msfconsole`)
- Sysmon (System Monitor)
- Splunk (Free Tier)
- Internal VM Networking
