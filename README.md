# Home Lab Projects

Welcome to my Home Lab Projects repository! This is where I document my hands-on experiments and learning with networking, cybersecurity, virtualization, and cloud technologies. The goal of this lab is to deepen my practical skills and build a portfolio of applied knowledge.

### Virtual Environment Setup
- Installed and configured Windows 10 and Kali Linux on **VirtualBox**
- Created a secure **internal network** for isolated communication between VMs

### ðŸ”¹ Defensive Security (Blue Team)
- Installed and configured Sysmon on the Windows VM for system event logging
- Set up Splunk to collect and visualize logs [DNS/HTTP]
- Uploaded, parsed, and normalized sample data to produce interesting fields to create clean logs for analysis
- Preformed mutliple queries based on log data to find anomlies, top results, relevant fields, etc

  
## Tools & Technologies
